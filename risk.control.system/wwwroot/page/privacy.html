            <h2>Cookie Details</h2>

            <p>By using the services of iCheckify, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read these carefully.</p>

            <h2>1. Essential Cookies (Required)</h2>
            <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly and cannot be disabled. They are essential for the basic operation of the website, including authentication (to verify users), session management (to remember your actions or selections during a session), and security features (such as preventing fraud and unauthorized access). Without these cookies, certain functions of the website, such as logging in, completing a purchase, or using secure areas, would not be possible. These cookies do not collect personal data or track your activity outside of the website. They are critical for the website’s security and functionality.</p>

            <h2>2. Analytics Cookies (Optional)</h2>
            <p>These cookies are used to collect information about how visitors interact with our website. They track user behavior, such as which pages are visited most often, how long users stay on certain pages, and any issues they encounter (such as error messages). This data helps us improve the design, layout, and content of our website, making it more user-friendly and effective. Analytics cookies provide us with valuable insights into user preferences, allowing us to continually optimize the user experience. All data gathered by analytics cookies is anonymized and aggregated, meaning it cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>

            <h2>3. Performance Cookies (Optional)</h2>
            <p>Performance cookies collect data regarding the performance of the website and how efficiently it works for users. For example, they help us monitor how quickly pages load and whether certain website features function as intended. This data is used to improve the site's performance by identifying areas that require optimization, such as adjusting for faster page load times or improving the reliability of specific website elements. By enabling these cookies, you help us ensure a faster, smoother, and more responsive browsing experience, ensuring that the site works seamlessly across different devices and network speeds.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. We use them to make the website work more efficiently, improve your experience, and provide us with insights into user activity. The cookies used on this site can either be persistent (stored on your device until you delete them) or session-based (which expire when you close your browser). We do not use cookies to collect personal information that could be used to identify you unless explicitly stated in our privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Managing Cookie Preferences</h2>
            <p>You have the right to choose which cookies you allow us to use. You can manage your cookie preferences through our Cookie Management page, where you can toggle which cookies are enabled or disabled. While essential cookies are necessary for the basic functionality of the site, you can choose to disable optional cookies like Analytics, Performance, and Targeting cookies, should you prefer. Please note that disabling certain cookies may impact the website's performance or user experience.</p>
